# mongoDB

Here, I am performing basic operarions in MongoDB using pymongo and pandas libraries (task_mongo_stu.py)
  and perform CRUD operations to manipulate data in MongoDB: 
      Create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) in telephone directory (task_mongo_crud.py)

Loaded the student.json dataset and create a database.
After that, insert the students record into the collection.

Queries need to answer:
1)      Find the student name who scored maximum scores in all (exam, quiz and homework)?
2)      Find students who scored below average in the exam and pass mark is 40%?
3)      Find students who scored below pass mark and assigned them as fail, and above pass mark as pass in all the categories.
4)      Find the total and average of the exam, quiz and homework and store them in a separate collection.
5)      Create a new collection which consists of students who scored below average and above 40% in all the categories.
6)      Create a new collection which consists of students who scored below the fail mark in all the categories.
7)      Create a new collection which consists of students who scored above pass mark in all the categories.
